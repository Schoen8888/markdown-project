# 📈 Understanding Credit Scores

A **credit score** is a number that represents your creditworthiness. Lenders use it to decide whether to approve loans or credit cards.

## 🔢 Score Ranges
| Range   | Rating        |
|---------|---------------|
| 300–579 | Poor          |
| 580–669 | Fair          |
| 670–739 | Good          |
| 740–799 | Very Good     |
| 800–850 | Excellent     |

## 🧮 Factors That Affect Your Score
1. **Payment History** (35%) – Do you pay bills on time and in full?
2. **Credit Utilization** (30%) – How much of your available credit you use? (Keep this under 30%)
3. **Length of Credit History** (15%) – How long you’ve had accounts. (This takes an average of your accounts you have open)
4. **Credit Mix** (10%) – Variety of credit types (cards, loans).
5. **New Credit** (10%) – Recent applications for credit.

> A higher score means lower risk for lenders, and you get better interest rates on mortgages, car payments, student loans, and more!
