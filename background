# **Background Information for Credit Cards**

- Credit cards are extremely useful financial tools that can be used to help advance your journey
- You spend on a credit card just like you spend on a debit card, but you end up paying all the money you spend back at the end of your 30 day billing period
- If you pay off your card in full and on time each month, effectively you are increasing your credit score and potentially earning rewards in the process

## ✨ **Rewards Options (Dependent on Which Card You Have)**
- Cash Back
- Points for Travel
