# 💳 Background Info on Credit Cards

Credit cards are financial tools that allow you to borrow money up to a certain limit and pay it back later. Debit cards take the money out of your account instantly, but with credit cards, you pay that money back at the end of your billing cycle. They are widely used for convenience, rewards, and building credit history.

## 📌 Key Concepts
- **Issuer**: The bank or company that provides the card.
- **Limit**: The maximum amount you can borrow.
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: The interest charged if you don’t pay in full.
- **Rewards**: Points, cash back, or miles earned on purchases.
